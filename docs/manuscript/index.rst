Welcome to DiffusionLab's documentation!
========================================

DiffusionLab is software designed to extract valuable information about the motion from single-molecule or particle trajectories obtained with e.g. super-resolution localization microscopy. DiffusionLab allows for facile segmentation of tracks in ‘populations’ based on their properties. The diffusion constant can be estimated with a method tailored to population characteristics and therefore allows the analysis of complex heterogeneous data sets.
